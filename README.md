# DevBoard

DevBoard is a work-in-progress full-stack engineering project where I’m teaching myself how to build real, production-style systems, not just code that works, but code that’s designed, documented, and deployable. I just started laying the groundwork with Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and React + TypeScript, and over time it’ll grow into a full productivity and collaboration platform with realtime updates, analytics, and even an AI assistant called Project Copilot. This repo will evolve as I learn. Each commit is part of the process of becoming a stronger, more deliberate engineer.
